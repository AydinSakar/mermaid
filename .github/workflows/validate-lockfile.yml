            ## üîç Lockfile Validation Failed

            One or more issues were found in `pnpm-lock.yaml`:
            - Tarball references are not allowed.
            - `packages/mermaid/src/vitepress` path must not appear in the lockfile.
            - `pnpm-lock.yaml` should only change when `package.json` changes.

            Please fix these issues and push an update.
